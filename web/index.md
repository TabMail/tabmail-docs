## What TabMail does (quick overview)

- **Chat about your email** (summaries, search, follow-ups)
- **Draft replies** and refine tone
- **Work faster** with keyboard-first workflows

## Feature highlights (Thunderbird)

These are the core workflows TabMail focuses on:

- **Smart Reply Drafts**: open a reply and see an AI draft ready to accept line-by-line (Tab) or all at once (Shift+Tab).
- **Tab Key Actions**: TabMail suggests actions (reply / archive / delete) and lets you apply them quickly.
- **Inline Autocomplete**: suggestions while composing emails.
- **Inline Commands**: type a natural-language instruction inside your draft to transform it.
- **Conversational agent**: chat about your mailbox and ask for actions.
- **Calendar integration**: ask about availability and propose meeting times.
- **Web search**: the agent can bring web context into your email work when needed.
- **Teachable tags**: train TabMail to categorize emails your way.
- **Custom rules/prompts**: steer the agent’s behavior to match your workflow.

> TabMail is designed so your mailbox stays in Thunderbird. The backend primarily handles authentication, quotas, and LLM completions — not long-term email storage.
