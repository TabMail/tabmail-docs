# Install + first run

## 1) Install TabMail in Thunderbird (v145)

1. Download the TabMail add-on.
2. In Thunderbird, open **Add-ons and Themes**.
3. Install the add-on package and enable it.

## 2) Sign in

1. Open TabMail in Thunderbird.
2. Click **Sign in** and complete the login flow.
3. Return to Thunderbird.

## 3) Open the chat window

Use the hotkey:

- **Windows/Linux**: **Alt+Ctrl+L**
- **macOS**: **Alt+Command+L**

## 4) First chat

Try one of these prompts:

- “Summarize my unread emails from today.”
- “Find the email about the invoice from last week.”
- “Draft a polite reply asking for a new ETA.”

## 5) Compose: plaintext mode requirement

TabMail’s compose features require **plaintext composition** in Thunderbird.

If autocomplete or inline commands don’t work, open TabMail’s settings and use the **Plaintext Composition** section to force plaintext for all identities.

## 4) What data is sent?

TabMail is designed to keep mailbox data in Thunderbird. The backend primarily handles authentication, quotas, and LLM completions.

> We’ll expand this section with an exact “what is sent vs. what stays local” table once the product UI text is finalized.
