# Troubleshooting

## “Sign in” doesn’t work / I get redirected

- Confirm you’re on **Thunderbird v145+**.
- Try signing in again from the TabMail UI.

## Autocomplete / inline commands don’t work in compose

TabMail currently requires **plaintext composition** in Thunderbird.

If your identity composes HTML by default, TabMail compose features may behave incorrectly. Open TabMail settings and use the **Plaintext Composition** section to force plaintext for all identities.

## TabMail is slow

- Large mailboxes can take longer for first-time indexing and initial requests.
- If the issue persists, capture what you were doing (what you clicked + what you asked) and open a support ticket.

## I see an error after asking a question

Open a support ticket and include:

- What you asked
- What happened (exact error text)
- Your Thunderbird version (v145+)
